teacher-library
==============

Template for a full-blown Vaadin application that only requires a Servlet 3.0 container to run (no other JEE dependencies).


Project Structure
=================

The project consists of the following three modules:

- parent project: common metadata and configuration
- teacher-library-widgetset: widgetset, custom client side code and dependencies to widget add-ons
- teacher-library-ui: main application module, development time
- teacher-library-production: module that produces a production mode WAR for deployment

The production mode module recompiles the widgetset (obfuscated, not draft), activates production mode for Vaadin with a context parameter in web.xml and contains a precompiled theme. The ui module WAR contains an unobfuscated widgetset, and is meant to be used at development time only.

Workflow
========

To compile the entire project, run "mvn install" in the parent project.

Other basic workflow steps:

- getting started
- compiling the whole project
  - run "mvn install" in parent project
- developing the application
  - edit code in the ui module
  - run "mvn jetty:run" in ui module
  - open http://localhost:8080/
- client side changes or add-ons
  - edit code/POM in widgetset module
  - run "mvn install" in widgetset module
  - if a new add-on has an embedded theme, run "mvn vaadin:update-theme" in the ui module
- debugging client side code
  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" in widgetset module
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application
- creating a production mode war
  - run "mvn -Pproduction package" in the production mode module or in the parent module
- testing the production mode war
  - run "mvn -Pproduction jetty:run-war" in the production mode module
